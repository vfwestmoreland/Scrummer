# Get Up Stand Up - (Stand up meeting timer)

This App was originally designed to help with keeping Stand Up meetings on time and participants engaged.
-You can set a duration, that will then be divided evenly among the participants, who are then set to a random order.

 
To install

-Git Clone - git@github.com:vfwestmoreland/Scrummer.git

-npm Install

Built With

-React.js
-Bootstrap
-Firebase (If you choose to use firebase you will need to have your own firebase account/project and API_KEY)

Currently this app is fully functional but still in early stages of development. I am anticipating many upgrades to functionality.

- Current Operating Functionality
 - You can sign up for access
 - Create and manage your personal profile (currently working on the ability to upload a profile picture)
 - Once Logged in depending upon your user level
    -Admin can create default teams/groups to be assigned to profiles and used for filtering when creating your customs Stand Up groups
    -Set the other users to Admin status and also delete the usersâ€™ profile. (This can be done two ways one in Firebase and the other through the app)

    -All users can Create their own custom meetings, edit their profile with Name and Associated Company Team.  Once these are completed you can then navigate to the home and your custom meetings will be stored until you would like to either delete them or create a new one.

Mostly the updates in the works will revolve around the user experience, the main goal being to bring fun and life to the morning standup.
